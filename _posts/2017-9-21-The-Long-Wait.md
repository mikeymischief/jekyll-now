title: The Long Wait

Hi, 

It's going to be a long wait until I receive my copy for Twilight Imperium 4. Right now I'm doing a bunch of research on TI3 about the races and the basic strategy. I'm actually so excited about this game and playing it for the first time with my friends. I hope they take to it as much as I do!
