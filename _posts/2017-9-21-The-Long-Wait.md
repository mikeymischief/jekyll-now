title: The Long Wait
---

Hi Everyone/No one! This is my first entry to my blog where I'm going to try and delve into the extensive world of Twilight Imperium 4! 

It's going to be a long wait until I receive my copy for Twilight Imperium 4. Right now I'm doing a bunch of research on TI3 about the races and the basic strategy. I'm actually so excited about this game and playing it for the first time with my friends. I hope they take to it as much as I do!

If you're wondering why the blog has changed, it's because I want to learn how to use github as well as the free hosting.
