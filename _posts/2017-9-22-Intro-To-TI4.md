Introduction to the races of Twilight Imperium!

This document serves as a summary of the races to help people pick their race before their first game. I have scoured the interwebs and have combined/updated/summarized these for our use.

Twilight Imperium's premise is a large-scale space opera. It is set in the unstable power vacuum left after the centuries-long decline and collapse of the previously dominant Lazax race. The old galactic central capital, Mecatol Rex, located in center of the map is maintained by custodians who maintain the imperial libraries and oversee the meetings of the galactic council. Players assume the roles of rising empires on the fringes of the galaxy, vying for military and political control, until one finally becomes sufficiently dominant to take over as a new galactic emperor.

Twilight Imperium is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every one of the seventeen faction offers a completely different play experience. These races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.

Below is the recommended races for each person according to playstyle and personality:

Jubee: Federation of Sol  
Jared: Sardakk N'orr  
Gerf: Barony of Letnev  
Beaud: Universities of Jol-Nar  
Jos: Embers of Muaat  
Eyay: Naalu Collective  
Mikey: Emirates of Hacan  
Brian: Xxcha Kingdom

## Starter Races
****

### [THE BARONY OF LETNEV](/races/BaronyOfLetnev)
Hailing from a strongly industrialized system, the Letnev race has a prominent leading caste that controls most of the sector's riches. They are known for their ability to mobilize and utilize their riches to power their massive fleet, and for the authority and leading ability to manage them effectively.  

These Warrior-nobles have a powerful two-planet home system that gives them arguably the best starting position in the game. Their mastery of logistics lets them “buy” offensive power and handle larger than usual fleets.

### [THE EMIRATES OF HACAN](/races/EmiratesOfHacan)
A desert-dwelling race of feline humanoids, their homeworlds are relatively poor in resources but abundant in rare herbs and spices. They built themselves up as a massive trading power and control much of the galaxy's wealth and economy.  

The Hacan value trade and diplomacy over militaristic might. They have more commodities to trade than any other race and can make deals with anyone, including trading action cards.

### [THE FEDERATION OF SOL](/races/FederationOfSol)
While humans are found basically everywhere in the universe, the ones that hail from their homeworld of Jord are unified in their purpose and seek to expand their influence. A most recent race to join the Empire, they are many, and use this as their strength.  

Empowered by their ability to quickly breed and train new troops, the Federation of Sol's carriers are second to none, and they recover quickly if they overextend themselves.

### [THE SARDAKK N'ORR](/races/SardakkNorr)
Insectoid creatures with a war-like attitude, the Sardakk excel in all forms of combat, in space as on the ground. However, they have never been the best in class and as such start a bit behind with tech.  

The Sardakk N'orr start with modest resources and a small fleet, but who can use their straightforward combat advantages to quickly build and conquer. Their dreadnoughts are custom-built to bombard ground forces before invasion.

### [THE UNIVERSITIES OF JOL'NAR](/races/UniversitiesOfJolNar)
The opposite to the Norr, this fish-like race dwells in large oceans and marine cities, exploring knowledge with enthusiasm and dedication. Their attitude for self-improvement is somehow mitigated by their innate ineptitude with weaponry and combat.  

The Hylar are intelligent, peaceful people known for their scientific research facilities on the twin planets Jol and Nar. They are not great in a fight, but can research new technology faster and more easily than any other race.

### [THE XXCHA KINGDOM](/races/XxchaKingdom)
Placid and calm reptile-creatures, they find their strength in the political arena, and have a strongly defensive tendency when it comes to warfare.  

A proud, ancient race of humanoid space turtles who can use their political contacts to avoid confrontation and to veto dangerous agendas (and action cards, with the right tech). They can annex other planets via pure diplomacy.

## Beginner Races
****

### [THE BROTHERHOOD OF YIN](/races/BrotherhoodOfYin)
Once originated from a rogue human, the Yin Brotherhood is a population of clones that revere their genetic blueprint as something not unlike a divine essence, a life-giver, and live and die by their devotion, to the point of being more than willing to die for it.  

A “race” of male clones driven by a shared religious fanaticism. Their holy fervor lets them convert the populace as they invade and make kamikaze ship attacks without hesitation. Once they take control of a planet, it's very hard to wrest control from them.

### [THE L1Z1X MINDNET](/races/L1z1xMindnet)
Cyborgs that claim to have been birthed from the remains of the Lazax emperors, the Mindnet wishes to retake what is rightfully theirs. Aggressively conquering everything they set their eyes on, their approach is marked by their characteristical Super Dreadnoughts, heavy capital ships that carry large amount of troops and fighter squadrons and are able to rain fire on the unfortunate defenders.  

These robots have immediate access to plenty of home-system resources, but very little diplomatic influence. They rely heavily on their powerful dreadnoughts and flagship, both in space combat and to bombard the enemy while invading.

### [THE MENTAK COALITION](/races/MentakCoalition)
A group of renegades and thieves, the Mentak are the perfect rendition of a space pirate, preferring small skirmishes and ambushes to full-fledged battles. Their ability to intercept trade convoys and rebuild damaged ships after conflicts make them a pain in the neck of everyone who dare cross their area of space, but a wealthy backer might just be able to sway them enough to gain their help... for a price.  

The Mentak, all descendants of what was once a system of prison planets, comes with an impressive fleet of ships. They can steal trade goods from other players and end certain space battles before their foe even gets off a shot.

## Intermediate Races
****

### [THE EMBERS OF MUAAT](/races/EmbersOfMuaat)
A race of burning energies barely contained in their own bodies, the strength of the stars fueling their very core, the Muaat were once enslaved by the Jol-Nar, and built their weapons with the ease of those who can mold metal with their bare hands. As the Hylars lost their grip on their world during the wars, the Muaat rose as an independent people, bringing the best of their handiwork to life in the powerful War Sun; a battlestation to rival any other ship in the galaxy... if not yet fully operational.  

These sentient fire-creatures can travel through supernovas effortlessly. At the beginning of the game, they are the only race who knows the secret of producing war suns, the deadliest ship that exists.

### [THE GHOSTS OF CREUSS](/races/GhostsOfCruess)
Strange, alien beings made of pure energy, they hail not from a planet within the galaxy, but from a planet outside of it, connected only by a spacial anomaly not unlike a wormhole. The Ghosts, as they are called, are master of dimensional travel and can easily slip through folds in space to reappear almost anywhere and use this mobility to prey on the unprepared.  

These beings of energy and light control wormholes for rapid movement and potentially use this movement for tactical advantage. Their home system is very difficult to reach, which is a mixed blessing: good for defense, bad for fast expansion.

### [THE NAALU COLLECTIVE](/races/NaaluCollective)
A race of snake-like women with telepatic abilities, the Naalu can come across as slippery, treacherous, and nasty, or otherwise as insightful, reactive, and clever.  

The Naalu act before everyone else and may retreat from unwinnable battles. Their fleets tend to heavily favor small ships and agile fighters.

### [THE WINNU](/races/Winnu)
The Winnu race was the first to be encountered by the Lazax, a millennia ago, and has served faithfully as custodians, servants, ambassadors and care-takers until the end of the empire. Now, they see themselves as the only logical successor as the ones who most rightfully can preserve the glorious inheritance and cultural history of the Lazax.  

These former stewards of Mecatol Rex have many supporters there. This makes it easier for them to quickly take control of Mecatol Rex, and lets them reinforce it easily. They can also choose their starting technology, which gives you plenty of starting options.

### [THE YSSARIL TRIBES](/races/YssarilTribes)
A people of small-sized, highly intelligent creatures once used as spies and infiltrators, finally acting independently. Their culture has a strong emphasis on the art of subterfuge and surprise, and one can never be sure what to expect of them.  

These Goblin-like guerilla fighters are masters of secret attacks and sabotage. They get a better selection of action cards, which they can also discard to “stall” indefinitely. And they start with a solid fleet and home system.

## Expert Races
****

### [THE ARBOREC](/races/Arborec)
A single-minded organism spanning several star systems, Arborec's spores can germinate fruit eveywhere in its domain, giving its growth a terrifying quality for those near its tendrils.  

These plant people produce new soldiers naturally and organically rather than via recruitment. They start off weak but grow exponentially more powerful as they amass ground forces on each planet, growing like a giant weed in the galaxy.

### [THE CLAN OF SAAR](/races/ClanOfSaar)
One of the most ancient races of the galaxy, the Clan does not really have a world to call their own. Instead, they move from place to place, wandering and collecting what resources they can before moving on, seeking a new home where they can one day be a proud people again.  

A scattered, nomadic race, whose space docks need not be anchored to a planet. Instead, they use them to journey from system to system, usually preferring to explore new planets rather than fighting to keep the ones they have.

### [THE NEKRO VIRUS](/races/NekroVirus)
As the L1z1x were born, not everything worked out correctly. Some experiments, some attempts, gave life to something extreme, an intelligence that was too much machine and too little man, learning, absorbing, churning flesh and data, able to quickly imitate but never innovate, hungry for knowledge and conquest alike. Able to copy any technological advancement but unable to curb their ambitions, the Nekro are a threat to the whole galaxy.  

A corrupted offshoot of the L1z1x, the Nekro Virus cannot take part in politics or technological advancement, but they will steal tech from every foe they injure, even if they lose the battle.
