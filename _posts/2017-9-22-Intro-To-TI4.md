Introduction to the races of Twilight Imperium!

This document serves as a summary of the races to help people pick their race before their first game. I have scoured the interwebs and have combined/updated/summarized these for our use.

Twilight Imperium's premise is a large-scale space opera. It is set in the unstable power vacuum left after the centuries-long decline and collapse of the previously dominant Lazax race. The old galactic central capital, Mecatol Rex, located in center of the map is maintained by custodians who maintain the imperial libraries and oversee the meetings of the galactic council. Players assume the roles of rising empires on the fringes of the galaxy, vying for military and political control, until one finally becomes sufficiently dominant to take over as a new galactic emperor.

Twilight Imperium is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every one of the seventeen faction offers a completely different play experience. These races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.

Below is the recommended races for each person according to playstyle and personality:

Jubee: Federation of Sol  
Jared: Sardakk N'orr  
Gerf: Barony of Letnev  
Beaud: Universities of Jol-Nar  
Jos: Embers of Muaat  
Eyay: Clan of Saar  
Mikey: Emirates of Hacan  
Brian: Xxcha Kingdom
