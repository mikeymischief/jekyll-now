**Strategy:**


I guess the best races are either: Clan of Saar, Arborec, Nekro, Mentak, Naalu Or Nekro, Mentak, Naalu, Sol, L1Z1X

See below:

Clan of Saar with space docks is very strong now. You can retreat with them. You can build right after moving. No need for logistical thinking, build it where you need it. And when you conquer planets, you get extra trade goods.

Similarly with Arborec. Just move and build. Place GFs on planets as backup. Not sure which race is stronger here. Maybe Saar with the extra capacity on the space docks. But Arborec also has to defend the home system. Both neighbors would have to keep the plants at bay.

Then again, these two races could be blown apart by 3xDestroyerII-s and a decent fleet to back it up. Yin would probably focus on destroyers. Or Sardakk N'orr if they are your neighbors. Not sure about that. So these 2 races could be either very strong or just decent.

Nekro is more or less the same but it can gain a bit more technologies than before. Since Command Counters are so rare in the new edition, I imagine Nekro would intentionally take Technology himself to get 3 CCs, maybe even spend another 6 resources to get another 3 CCs. Seems like this abuse would benefit Nekro much more than picking Leadership. That's why Nekro would be much stronger in this game.

Mentak is mostly same as before. Can get CruiserII as 2nd tech, could get war suns quickly. Could also go for racial techs. I think it depends whether you can get a planet with a tech specialty and what type, anything but blue. The starting fleet is a bit weak. Hard to expand. Very Nekro-like hit-and-run tactics. Best flagship IMO. Works against Letnev, L1Z1X and anyone who builds War Suns. My favorite race so I am a bit biased.

Naalu is still strong, a bit weaker than before, I think. 0 Initiative is always powerful. If they can get the racial techs, no-one would want to attack them.

Sol can have bigger fighter screens than others. Also the extra Command Counter is super useful. Seems like most races would prefer to get the tech which gives extra Command Counters. The flagship can carry 12 units! That could be stupidly strong. Also all the infantry bonuses, it seems like this race is more about numbers than anyone else. Having the production and logistics to get the swarm anywhere is going to be hard, especially when there is a Saar Ball of Death rolling around regenerating all the time.

L1Z1X Dreadnoughts are super nice now. And they can bombard every round during ground invasion. That is incredibly powerful en masse. No need to carry that much infantry anymore. Just nuke it from orbit. If you are lucky and can get a yellow tech planet, you could get Inheritance System and get any tech by the 3rd round. War Suns or better Dreadnoughts? The flagship is strong.

Letnev is mostly same as before. If they can hoard trade goods, they could really shine in combat. In large battles, being able to reroll all missed dice is huge. Very nice production at home too.

Jol-Nar can build a lot of tech as before. Not sure if it negates the -1 to combat rolls.

Yssaril is still strong with the extra action cards. Then again, he does not really have get that many action cards per round. The expanding force is quite strong though.

Hacan seems quite strong by itself. I guess you can trade in the beginning but once you start getting ahead, other players will just stop trading with you. The 3-planet home system is nice and all but if your only special ability is eliminated, you're going to fall behind.

Xxcha can turtle a lot. That's mostly it. Based on the public objectives, that might be better than it sounds. The flagship with 4 space docks in one system could defend 7 systems simultaneously. 8 hits (with first red tech) before combat to anyone who gets near you.

Muaat is a bit stronger than before. Getting War Sun with movement of 3 is much easier now. Seems like getting War Sun is not that important for other races - they have other things going on. Jol-Nar and Mentak could because they are already half-way there.

Sardakk N'orr starts with no techs. A lot of objectives require you to have technologies. So if you are not lucky with the objective deck, you are fucked. Starting with 2 carriers is nice though.

Yin is OK. Nothing that great about them. Not sure if stronger than other races. The ability to sacrifice units to kill enemy ships could pay off in small-sized battles.

Creuss can be all over the map easily. Not sure if that is good or not. Overextending with them can be really easy.

Winnu is super weak now. Where to start... The only thing it has going for it is controlling Mecatol Rex. If it doesn't it has nothing. Starting with only one technology which can be chosen at the beginning of the game. The starting fleet moves slowly. You can reach MR by round 3. Maybe round 2 if lucky and you get Warfare. The other players can still stop you from reaching MR at relatively low costs. First, during the galaxy creation phase they can just place the supernova between Winnu HS and MR. This adds 2 movement to reach MR. Another thing they can do is to move their faster ships to hover over MR so you wouldn't get it. Mentak and Jol Nar would probably research Cruiser II so moving in there is quite easy for them. And then they can take it whenever they want to. Yeah, you could buy some techs to speed you up but by then the opponents could already be swarming MR. Since your starting fleet honestly sucks, you can not justify rushing MR. Maybe you will get there by round 4. By then EVERYONE already wants to take MR anyway. You getting there first to be immediately kicked out is not worth it but that's the only thing that makes you different from others.
