Welcome to the Synergy Cube!

If you're here, it's probably because you want to learn about the my cube. I have recently changed the major philosophy from way back when I started from a maximum power cube (est. 2006) to one built on synergies and archetypes. The main difference from before was that many cards could not see play because the powerband of existing cards would just push out fun/synergistic decks. I've decided to remedy that and now the cube is at a lower power level, but allows more strategies to exist.

## Building a Cube

In the course of my journey, I've probably changed upwards of 100 cards to reflect this, removing major powerstones of the previous format (Skullclamp, Opposition, Umezawa's Jitte...) and replaced it with synergistic archetypes that are built on themes placed in the mono-colored sections. Each of these sections comprises of many themes, that while distinct from each other are synergistic when put together. This differs from a lower-powered cube built the same way because those drafts tend to be "on-rails". This draft environment is very much in the middle, which straddles power with synergy; where one does not overwhelm the other, but in harmony together.

How is this done? Well, by introducing many archetypes in each color whose themes align with one another and peppering that philosphy with payoff cards to reward drafters in those lanes. Therefore, choosing a build-around card can create decks, but so can picking archetype-strengthening cards as well. Too many strictly defined archetypes will result in "on-rails" drafting and too many powerful cards will have players draft piles of "good stuff" decks; that's not what I want in this environment. Seeded within the cube's multicolor sections are cards that hint towards archetypes, much like a retail draft. Depending on the depth of these archetypes, each guild pair can consist of one or more archetypes. The best thing about cube is that it's not about drafting these creator-defined decks, but drafting things you can make up on your own; emergent gameplay! 

You can be as creative as you wish, but just know that this isn't a purely Johnny/Jenny cube in that your deck still needs to follow in the normal trappings of a draft deck. Aggro, mid-range, tempo and control are all present here and your deck will likely fall under one of those macro-archetypes. 

## My Cube

As I just mentioned, your deck can fall under any of the generic macro-archetype shells: aggro, mid-range, tempo or control. There are pleny of cards with the power-level to create those decks. But there are also many other decks that can be drafted for those willing to try.

You can see the list of the cube [here](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/list/mischief_unpowered) and you can practice draft against bots [here](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/playtest/mischief_unpowered).

In all the highlighted archetypes below, I will include a sample draft of that deck.

## Archetypes
----

### Selesnya Tokens
[WG Tokens](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5ee06b3e4724960f53959a08)

<img src="/images/mtg/isd-19-intangible-virtue.jpg" alt="Intangible Virtue" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/grn-208-trostani-discordant.jpg" alt="Trostani Discordant" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/dtk-36-secure-the-wastes.jpg" alt="Secure the Wastes" width="200"/>

The token deck looks to pair token creators with anthems in order to create overwhelming board states. This deck plays much like a white aggro deck during the early stages of the game then pivots into exploding with many flying tokens to finish off unsuspecting opponents. Using green, you get Trostani Discordant, red has even more token creators with Hanweir Garrison and Goblin Rabblemaster. Don't forget there is a perfect signpost card in Boros with Heroic Reinforcements.

### Rakdos Welder Artifacts
[BR Welder Artifacts](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5ee0574a4724960f5394a98f)

<img src="/images/mtg/ulg-80-goblin-welder.jpg" alt="Goblin Welder" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/c14-33-daretti-scrap-savant.jpg" alt="Daretti, Scrap Savant" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/kld-96-noxious-gearhulk.jpg" alt="Noxious Gearhulk" width="200"/>

Rakdos (and red in particular) has a subtheme of artifacts to create texture within many midrange and big red decks. This deck seeks to exploit the synergy with Goblin Welder and the graveyard by using discard enablers to dump those cards like Noxious Gearhulk into the graveyard then using Daretti, Scrap Savant or Goblin Welder to bring it back into play! This deck can have some explosive starts, but you'll still need to have all 3 pieces of the combo to do it by turn 2. Regardless, this is a powerful deck that can create many exciting game play moments.

### Gruul Wildfire
[GR Wildfire](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5edef6c74724960f5382d3f9)

<img src="/images/mtg/usg-228-wildfire.jpg" alt="Wildfire" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/5dn-114-crucible-of-worlds.jpg" alt="Crucible of Worlds" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/m11-192-primeval-titan.jpg" alt="Primeval Titan" width="200"/>

A classic deck from back in the power-max cube days. This archetype has still survived and is poised to still be a threat. What this deck does is try to accelerate mana production by using numerous manarocks (Mind Stone, Talismans), droping a 5+ toughness creature, preferably something like Primeval Titan, and then playing a Wildfire or Burning of Xinye the following turn. Pairing this with blue, gets you card filtering to find Wildfire faster, pairing with green get you recursive lands and many large fatties. Wildfile works with any of the other colors and is one of the premier big red decks in the format. 

### Orzhov Human Aggro
[WB Human Aggro](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5edee99a4724960f53823b99)

<img src="/images/mtg/c20-335-general-kudro-of-drannith.jpg" alt="General Kudro of Drannith" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/isd-6-champion-of-the-parish.jpg" alt="Champion of the Parish" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/soi-43-thalia-s-lieutenant.jpg" alt="Thalia's Lieutenant" width="200"/>

Human Tribal aggro is viable and fast aggro deck, and one of the newer enabled archetypes by lowering the power level. Within this deck, you are planning on using white and black disruption to keep opponents off-kilter while your aggressive creatures finish them off. White gets many taxing effects (Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, Vryn Wingmare) and black gets all the discard with cards like Thoughtseize and Duress. Corpse Knight is a great way to keep the pressure on while playing to the board. There are many ways to recover post-sweeper, like Luminous Broodmoth, Xathrid Necromancer or even Hollowed Spiritkeeper.

### Dimir Ninjas
[UB Ninjas](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5edd6973d65648101a0d4b61)

<img src="/images/mtg/mh1-204-ingenious-infiltrator.jpg" alt="Ingenious Infiltrator" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/bok-44-ninja-of-the-deep-hours.jpg" alt="Ninja of the Deep Hours" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/bok-88-throat-slitter.jpg" alt="Throat Slitter" width="200"/>

Everyone loves ninjas! This tempo deck plays like an aggro control deck with some disruption, abusing Enter-the-battlefield effects on creatures and drawing cards. With a few ninjas, this is still a competitive deck, just don't forget you'll need some enablers for _ninjutsu_ with blue fliers, black menace or deathtouch and even some artifact assistance with cards like Key to the City! 

### UG Self-Mill
[Simic Laboratory](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5edd53bad65648101a0cbcd6)

<img src="/images/mtg/uma-61-laboratory-maniac.jpg" alt="Laboratory Maniac" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/uma-167-golgari-grave-troll.jpg" alt="Golgari Grave-Troll" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/war-54-jace-wielder-of-mysteries.jpg" alt="Jace, Wielder of Mysteries" width="200"/>

There is plenty of support for the UG Self-Mill deck and just as many payoffs. You can take this deck to the extreme with the Laboratory Maniac, Jace, Wielder of Mysteries and Thassa's Oracle "combo" route, or you can take it to a beatdown aspect. Cards like Golgari Grave-Troll can come back to play if you accidentally mill them, and Body Double feels like a tutor for the best creature in your graveyard, there is an Embalm on Vizier of Many Faces. This deck is only restricted by your creativity. With multiple looters in blue and filtering in green, this deck is definitely one to watch.

### Golgari Graveyard
[Golgari Graveyard](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5edd58284724960f536fed04)

<img src="/images/mtg/c15-49-meren-of-clan-nel-toth.jpg" alt="Meren of Clan Nel Toth" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/ori-106-liliana-heretical-healer.jpg" alt="Liliana, Heretical Healer" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/mma-166-tarmogoyf.jpg" alt="Tarmogoyf" width="200"/>

Another classic archtype deck, Green and Black Graveyard recursion. The idea is to try and reuse creatures from an endless graveyard. You don't care about your creatures as you expect to get them back. For kicks, you can power up this archetype by drafting the large bombs: Living Death or Twilight's Call. You can just build a value version which just reuses creature over and over from cards like Phyrexian Reclamation. You can go for a combo and try running reanimator with Dread Return or Vicitmize paired with any of the green or black fatties.

### Kallax Instants
[Temur Kallax Instants](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5edffc3064abb70f9b340d2f)

<img src="/images/mtg/c20-9-kalamax-the-stormsire.jpg" alt="Kalamax, the Stormsire" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/m14-163-young-pyromancer.jpg" alt="Young Pyromancer" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/war-234-saheeli-sublime-artificer.jpg" alt="Saheeli, Sublime Artificer" width="200"/>

This one is a new build-around; Kalamax, the Stormsire. This deck just asks that you build him with instants to churn through your deck. You can be more spell-based or creature-based, but the namesake card just ties what this shard is trying to do; use green for the beats and the spells for controlling the board.

### Grixis Control
[UBR Control](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5edea3c664abb70f9b2b3bfb)

<img src="/images/mtg/mh1-206-kess-dissident-mage.jpg" alt="Kess, Dissident Mage" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/plc-85-damnation.jpg" alt="Damnation" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/mb1-701-liliana-death-s-majesty.jpg" alt="Liliana, Death's Majesty" width="200"/>

One of my favorite archetypes, Grixis Control is drafted by trying to control the board with spells that trade one-for-one and then using blue to draw cards to out card advantage your opponent. Bonus points for reusing those spells once they're cast with things like Snapcaster Mage, _Flashback_, Bond of Insight. Blue and Red have a spells-matters theme that fits perfectly with what this deck wants to accomplish. Red is versatile because the burn can be used to kill creatures to pave the way for your tiny creatures or go straight to the fact. Grixis is all about versatility and this deck does not disappoint.

### Jund Lands
[Jund Land Stompy](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5ede7826f3c0f00f5e8d256c)

<img src="/images/mtg/uma-172-life-from-the-loam.jpg" alt="Life from the Loam" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/mh1-217-wrenn-and-six.jpg" alt="Wrenn and Six" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/c14-50-titania-protector-of-argoth.jpg" alt="Titania, Protector of Argoth" width="200"/>

Another new archetype that can shine since the removal of the power-oppressive cards. The lands deck was always just a bit underpowered with

## Discover the Cube

There are many more archetypes not listed here, which are meant for players to explore and find on their own. There's blue-white blink, 5-color Golos, Hellbent Rakdos Aggro and many more. The cube is changing all the time; balancing archetypes which add unexpected synergies that tranform the cube metagame. I hope you have as much fun drafting and playing this cube as much as I've had creating it!
