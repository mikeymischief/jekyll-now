Welcome to the Synergy Cube!

If you're here, it's probably because you want to learn about the my cube. I have recently changed the major philosophy from way back when I started from a maximum power cube (est. 2006) to one built on synergies and archetypes. The main difference from before was that many cards could not see play because the powerband of existing cards would just push out fun/synergistic decks. I've decided to remedy that and now the cube is at a lower power level, but allows more strategies to exist.

## Building a Cube

In the course of my journey, I've probably changed upwards of 100 cards to reflect this, removing major powerstones of the previous format (Skullclamp, Opposition, Umezawa's Jitte...) and replaced it with synergistic archetypes that are built on themes placed in the mono-colored sections. Each of these sections comprises of many themes, that while distinct from each other are synergistic when put together. This differs from a lower-powered cube built the same way because those drafts tend to be "on-rails". This draft environment is very much in the middle, which straddles power with synergy; where one does not overwhelm the other, but in harmony together.

How is this done? Well, by introducing many archetypes in each color whose themes align with one another and peppering that philosphy with payoff cards to reward drafters in those lanes. Therefore, choosing a build-around card can create decks, but so can picking archetype-strengthening cards as well. Too many strictly defined archetypes will result in "on-rails" drafting and too many powerful cards will have players draft piles of "good stuff" decks; that's not what I want in this environment. Seeded within the cube's multicolor sections are cards that hint towards archetypes, much like a retail draft. Depending on the depth of these archetypes, each guild pair can consist of one or more archetypes. The best thing about cube is that it's not about drafting these creator-defined decks, but drafting things you can make up on your own; emergent gameplay! 

You can be as creative as you wish, but just know that this isn't a purely Johnny/Jenny cube in that your deck still needs to follow in the normal trappings of a draft deck. Aggro, mid-range, tempo and control are all present here and your deck will likely fall under one of those macro-archetypes. 

## My Cube

As I just mentioned, your deck can fall under any of the generic macro-archetype shells: aggro, mid-range, tempo or control. There are pleny of cards with the power-level to create those decks. But there are also many other decks that can be drafted for those willing to try.
