## THE WINNU

**In a word:** Custodians of the ancient empire

**Background:** Now that the empire has fallen and the imperial race has disappeared from the universe, the Winnu have upheld the lore, tradition, and culture of the old empire.  Although they had hoped that the imperial race would return and restore the glory of the empire, they have started to lose hope in that dream.  Now many of the Winnu feel that they are the rightful successors to the Empire.  Now is the time to put an end to this age of chaos and return the universe to it's former glory.  The Winnu will protect and honor the heritage of the empire forever.

**Pros/Cons:** The Winnu always add the influence of their home system planet to votes, even if the home system planet has been exhausted.  This gives them a bit more political power than other races.  Also, if they have at least one ground force on a planet, it is immune from the Local Unrest Action card.  This prevents you from losing planets due to this pesky card.  Finally, you don't need to spend a command counter to execute the secondary ability of the Technology Strategy.  This gives you a minor boost in developing technologies.

**Style:** Everything centers around controlling Mecatol Rex with this race.
