## THE CLAN OF SAAR

**In a word:** Warrior Space Gypsies 

**Background:** Saar is believed to be the first race to begin galactic exploration outside of the Core. It is unknown if they began exploration out of need or curiousity but it is known that they spread their resources too thin in exploration and were almost brought to extinction by other races. Having no true planet to call home, the Clan of Saar reside on two large asteroids where they have begun to pull the remnants of their species to gather. Being the primary race responsible for their near extinction, the Clan of Saar hates Sardakk N'Orr and seek to weaken them as often as possible.

A highly mobile and nomadic race.  They don't stay in any one place for long.  They pick up and move everything with them.  These nomads have long been kicked around by more established races, but this has made the Clan strong.  The Clan is at home anywhere and are good at salvaging on planets they conquer.  Now that the Clan is strong, it is time to take some bigger prizes--perhaps the biggest one of all, Mecatol Rex.

**Pros/Cons:** Have mobile star bases, can still collect victory points if their home system is occupied, gain bonus trade goods for capturing planets, good trade agreements, rubbish home system, good starting fleet.

**Style:** For a player looking to play a subtle and crafty game, utilizing mobility and trade goods to gain influence in the galaxy.
