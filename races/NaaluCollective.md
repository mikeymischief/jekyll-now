## THE NAALU COLLECTIVE

**In a word:** Telepathic Snakes

**Background:** The Naala are surrounded in mystery. During the rule of the Lazax over the Imperium, the existance of the Naalu were not even known to any race other than that of the Yssaril, who had a secret alliance with the Naalu. Toward the end of the Twilight Wars, the Naalu emerged from places unknown, ready to make their claim for the throne. Many of the Great Races sought an alliance with the beautiful, serpentine creatures, but quickly withdrew when learning of their telepathic abilities. The Naalu have no desire for war but are not fearful of it. They believe the time now nears when the rest of the galaxy will know the tranquillity, order, and the true beauty of the Naalu. The rest of the galaxy will submit to that beauty or be destroyed.

**Advantages**: Always acts first in initiative order, powerful Fighters, several unique ways to mess with opponents, balanced starting fleet and Home System, one of the most powerful Racial Technologies in the game.

**Disadvantages**: Always acts first in initiative order, difficult to master, annoying abilities may draw the ire of other players, not recommended for learning games.

**Style:** The psychic snakes like to attack into their opponents and then retreat immediately. By performing these hit-and-run tactics, they are using their racial abilities to the maximum. Any race that chases them costs them a bunch of Command Counters, slowly defeating their enemies through manipulation.
