## THE MENTAK COALITION

**In a word:** Space pirates

**Background:** The rag-tag inhabitants of a prison-planet who overthrew their Lazax masters when the Imperium began to crumble, and now terrorize the space-lanes with lightening raids, taking what they want then leaving.

**Pros/Cons:** Can steal trade goods from other players, get free shots before battle begins, poor trade agreements, decent homeworld, strong starting fleet.

**Style:** For the player who doesn't mind pissing-off the other players via dirty tricks like stealing trade goods and striking out for aggressive raids with their cruisers (which get a sneak attack before enemy can shoot back).

>Homeworlds: Moll Primus (4/1)
>
>Starting Units: 1 carrier; 2 cruisers; 3 fighters; 4 infantry; 1 space dock; 1 pds
>
>Starting Tech: sarween tools; plasma scoring 
>
>Commodities: 2

>Promissory Note: Promise of Protection - Action: Place this card faceup in your play area. While this card is in your play area, the Mentak player cannot use his Pillage faction ability against you. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Mentak player's units, return this card to the Mentak player.
