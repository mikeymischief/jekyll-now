## THE L1Z1X MINDNET

**In a Word:** Warlike cyborgs

**Background:** The remnants of the Lazax, ancient rulers of the Imperium, returned in cyborg form thirsty for revenge. They come from their remote, wealthy world, a nightmare planet of technology ready to reclaim the empire they fled from generations ago.

**Pros/Cons:** Cheaper and more powerful dreadnaughts, twice as much starting techonology as everyone else (save the Universities of Jol-Nar), poor trade agreements, good home system, powerful starting fleet.

**Style:** For a player who wants to play a military aggressive style, but without the need to be quite as aggressive as Letnev since you've got good technology and strong Dreadnoughts.

>
>Starting Units: 1 dreadnought; 1 carrier; 3 fighters; 5 infantry; 1 space dock; 1 pds
