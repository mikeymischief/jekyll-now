## THE SARDAKK N'ORR

**In a word:** Warrior bugs

**Background:** Repugnant insectoids who inhabit massive skyscrapers on their crowded homeworlds surrounded by great network of orbital space stations and massive complements of fleet units.

**Pros/Cons:** Get +1 to all combat rolls, decent trade agreements, mediocre home system, decent starting fleet. No starting technology (A lot of objectives require you to have technologies), hard for them to keep up.

**Style:** For the players who likes the idea of swarming the enemy with lots of cheap ships that hit harder than anyone else's ship-for-ship.

>**Homeworlds**:  Trenâ€™lak (1/0); Quinarra (3/1)
>
>**Starting Units**: 2 carrier; 1 cruiser; 5 infantry; 1 space dock; 1 pds
>
>**Starting Tech**: None
>
>**Commodities**: 3
>
>**Promissory Note**: _Tekklar Legion_ - At the start of an invasion combat: Apply +1 to the result of each of your unit's combat rolls during this combat. If your oppoent is the Sardakk N'orr player, apply -1 to the result of each of his unit's combat rolls during this combat. Then, return this card to the Sardakk N'orr player.
