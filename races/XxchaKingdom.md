## THE XXCHA KINGDOM

**In a Word:** Politicians

**Background:** One of the first great civilizations of the galaxy.  These space turtles are peaceful and prefer to solve problems through diplomacy rather than through violence.  In the fall of the Empire, they were caught weaponless and defenseless, which led to the destruction of one of their home worlds.  Although they prefer the path of peace, the Xxcha do not want to suffer such a tragedy again.  Therefore, they have focused on developing strong defenses.  In order to insure a peaceful galaxy for future generations, the Xxcha have no choice but to take the Imperial throne for themselves and make war a thing of the past.

**Advantages**: Powerful in the Political arena, may always use Diplomacy Strategy to their best advantage, strong Racial technologies, well-balanced in many ways.

**Disadvantages**: Starting fleet can hinder early advancement, most abilities require Command Counters to activate and can only be used once per turn.

**Style:** For someone who prefers political wrangling to brute force, but with a decent stick to beat people with using a defensive military, waiting for that perfect moment to strike.

**How to Play:** In general, you will want to play defensive and use the Construction Strategy Card a lot to build up a network of Planetary Defense System (PDS). You do have a decent starting fleet to expand early, keep control of those and score objectives. Technologies that are important to the Xxcha are Plasma Scoring and going for PDS II. Overall, as the space turtles, you will like green technology the best.
