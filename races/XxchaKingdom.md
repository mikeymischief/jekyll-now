## THE XXCHA KINGDOM

**In a Word:** Politicians

**Background:** One of the first great civilizations of the galaxy.  These space turtles are peaceful and prefer to solve problems through diplomacy rather than through violence.  In the fall of the Empire, they were caught weaponless and defenseless, which led to the destruction of one of their home worlds.  Although they prefer the path of peace, the Xxcha do not want to suffer such a tragedy again.  Therefore, they have focused on developing strong defenses.  In order to insure a peaceful galaxy for future generations, the Xxcha have no choice but to take the Imperial throne for themselves and make war a thing of the past.

**Pros/Cons:** Can veto political agendas, enemies get a -1 to hit in the first round of combat against them, good trade agreements, mediocre home system, weak starting fleet.

**Style:** For someone who prefers political wrangling to brute force, but with a decent stick to beat people with using a defensive military, waiting for that perfect moment to strike.
