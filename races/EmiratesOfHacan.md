## THE EMIRATES OF HACAN

**In a word:** Mercantilists

**Background:** These space lions are the masters of trade.  Your smugglers and traders have infiltrated every corner of the galaxy.  If there's any business going on in the galaxy, it's guaranteed that you have your paws in it. The Hacan always have an abundance of trade goods and have the power to help out other races or to hurt them severely when trade is involved.  The Hacan never have to worry about having enough resources to build units and can use their trade good to bribe other races to agree with their policies.  Nothing personal, it's just business.

**Advantages**: Undisputed masters of trade, multiple ways to get lots of trade goods, only three planet Home System in the game.

**Disadvantages**: Average starting position, easy to become distracted by their wealth.

**Style:** Master of trade. For the player who wants to forge an economic powerhouse, doing lots of wheeling-and-dealing on the diplomatic stage, but still nothing to sniff at warfare-wise, since all that filthy lucre can be used to build massive fleets.
