## THE BROTHERHOOD OF YIN

**In a word:** Warrior Zealots

**Background:** Genetically-modified fanatic adherents of a bizarre cult centred around long-dead scientist named Darien who illegally cloned hundreds of his children in an effort to save his wife from a deadly disease who now seek to bind all to their religion.

**Pros/Cons:** Beasts in ground combat, can do kamikaze runs to destroy enemy ships, poor trade agreements, poor home system, very strong starting fleet.

**Advantages**: Ability to easily gain Ground Forces in many ways, can guarantee a hit on crucial targets in Space Combat.

**Disadvantages**: Poor trade, lackluster Racial Technologies.

**Style:** Another race for a very aggressive style of play. Can convert enemies.
